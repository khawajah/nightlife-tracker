# Nightlife Tracker 

I am building this Nightlife Tracker app as part of Free Code Camp's Back End Certification curriculum. Right now, you can search for bars in your area. Eventually, you will be able to indicate your intention to go.

Building using:
- [Clementine.js](http://www.clementinejs.com), Angular version, as boilerplate (MEAN stack)
- [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and this unstyled [Scrolling Nav template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/)
- Yelp's search API
