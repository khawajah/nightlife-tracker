# Nightlife Tracker 

I am building this Nightlife Tracker app as part of Free Code Camp's Back End Certification curriculum. Right now, you can search for bars in your area, and indicate your intention to go tonight. You can also see all your historical RSVPs and remove ones you don't want on that list (though no one can see it but you).

To-dos:
- Have RSVPs add to RSVP list dynamically as they're created. Currently, you only see your most recent clicks if you reload the page.

Building using:
- [Clementine.js](http://www.clementinejs.com), Angular version, as boilerplate (MEAN stack)
- [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and this unstyled [Scrolling Nav template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/)
- Yelp's search API
