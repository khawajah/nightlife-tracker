# Nightlife Tracker 

I am building this Nightlife Tracker app as part of Free Code Camp's Back End Certification curriculum. Eventually, it will allow you to search for a bar in your area and indicate your intention to go. 

Building using:
- Clementine.js as boilerplate (Node, Express.js, Passport.js)
- Swig for templates
- [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) and this unstyled [Scrolling Nav template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/)
